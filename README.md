# 🎬 Box Office Revenue Prediction Using Regression

## 📅 Project Duration
February 2025 – March 2025

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict box office revenues of movies **before their release** using historical datasets and machine learning regression techniques. We developed models including **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** to estimate potential revenue based on various movie attributes.

This helps stakeholders like producers and marketers make informed decisions and optimize strategies prior to release.
